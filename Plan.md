1. **Define Key Components**
   - Summarize the core components of the Transformer architecture (Encoder, Decoder, Self-Attention, Positional Encoding).

2. **Explain How It Works**
   - Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the Transformer model's functioning.

3. **List Applications**
   - Identify and describe various applications of Transformer architecture in AI, particularly in NLP and computer vision.

4. **Highlight Advantages**
   - Discuss the advantages of using Transformer architecture over traditional models like RNNs.

5. **Structure HTML Dashboard**
   - Create a visually appealing HTML layout to present the information clearly and engagingly.
